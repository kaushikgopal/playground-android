/**
 * Event mapper interface for filtering and transforming events before they reach a plugin.
 *
 * UsfEventMapper serves three primary purposes in the USF architecture:
 * 1. Event Filtering - Determines which events should be processed by a specific plugin
 * 2. Event Transformation - Transforms events from parent types to plugin-specific types
 * 3. Type Safety - Acts as a bridge between parent event types and strongly-typed plugin events
 *
 * When a plugin is registered with a view model, an event mapper is used to determine if an
 * incoming event should be processed by that plugin. Only if the mapper returns a non-null value
 * will the event be forwarded to the plugin's processEvent method.
 *
 * This pattern allows multiple plugins to selectively handle different event types without needing
 * to expose plugin implementation details to the parent view model.
